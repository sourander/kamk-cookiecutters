# Vision and Scope

This is the document where you explain the vision and the scope The source of this documents are **the business requirements**.

## Business requirements

The business requirements are the high-level needs of the organization. What is the organization hoping to achieve? The book Software Requirements gives an example: *"Suppose and airline wants to reduce airport counter staff cost by 25 percent. This goal might lead to the idea of building a kiosk that passengers can use to check in for their flights at the airport."* [^34a4a8] This is only one goal. Normally there are several goals.

The goals typically come from:

* **Funding sponsor**. An organization that is paying for the project.
* **Manager of the end user**. Someone in another team or department within your company.
* **Marketing department**. This is another department within your company, but with a different perspective.
* **Product visionary**. Product owner who represents the end user and provides visionary ideas.

In our context, as learners at Kajaani Ammattikorkeakoulu, this is typically one of the three options:

1. A comission from a company
2. A fake comission from the teacher
3. A project idea that the team has come up with
