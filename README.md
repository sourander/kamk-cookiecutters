# kamk-cookiecutters

Various cookiecutters for creating course-related files and directories.

## Prerequisites

* Docker (Desktop)

If you have no idea of what cookiecutter is, spend 1-2 minutes reading this short documentation page: [Cookiecutter docs: Overview](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html).

## Usage

We will use Docker to run the cookiecutter command, utilizing **uvx** (an alias for `uv tool run`). The uv is a Python package installer. The command `uv tool` is an interface for running Python-based tools without installation. We will run uv in a Docker container, so the is no need to even install uv. 

#### üêß Linux / MacOS

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
-v "$(pwd):/workspace" \
-w /workspace \
ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.11-bookworm \
uvx cookiecutter gh:sourander/kamk-cookiecutters -f
```

üîë Running as sudo? Read more below. [^1]

#### üê¶ Git Bash (in Windows)

```bash
winpty docker run -it --rm \
-v "/$(pwd):/workspace" \
-w '//workspace' \
ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.11-bookworm \
uvx cookiecutter gh:sourander/kamk-cookiecutters -f
```


#### üü¶ PowerShell

```powershell
docker run -it --rm `
-v "${PWD}:/workspace" `
-w /workspace `
ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.11-bookworm `
uvx cookiecutter gh:sourander/kamk-cookiecutters -f
```

### Why the `-f` flag?

The `-f` flag is used to force the cookiecutter to override the existing files. This is required if you want to use the `.` as the target folder, because "this folder" exists.

Running the command above will prompt you to choose a cookiecutter from the list of available cookiecutters. After choosing a cookiecutter, you will be prompted to fill in the required fields. Below is an example of creating a learning diary for a course.

## Using Templates

When launching the `cookiecutter` command, you will be prompted to choose a cookiecutter from the list of available cookiecutters. The available cookiecutters are:

1. Oppimisp√§iv√§kirja (a learning diary)
2. Project (a project documentation)

### Oppimisp√§iv√§kirja (learning diary)

**Animaatio 1:** *Oppimisp√§iv√§kirja -mallin valinta ja t√§ytt√∂.*

**TIP:** If you are interested in creating similar GIF animations, you can use tool `asciinema` for recording and `agg` for GIF conversion. The tools may not be compatible with Windows.

The steps and brief explanations are in the table below:

| Course name       | The name of the course you are in. The default value is always shown in brackets. |
| Course slug       | A slugified course name. You typically do not need to change this.                |
| Containing folder | The default is the current folder (`.`). Default requires the `-f` flag.          |
| Author            | Your Full Name.                                                                   |

How to write a project documentation? The template itself includes a guide for this! Also, the introduction lesson of the course will guide you through the process. If not, ask your teacher.

### Itsearviointi (self-evaluation)

This lacks the GIF-animation, since the process is similar to the previous ones.

## Footnotes

[^1]: Running as sudo? They may be reasons to run the command with `sudo` (e.g., permission issues in a classroom or in a lab space). You will identify this by the error message `Permission denied` to a socker `/var/run/docker.sock`. Running the command again with `sudo` prefix will solve the issue partly. If you do this, the command will work, and template files will be created into your current directory, but the created files will be owned by root. To fix this, you can change ownership like this: `sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) .`
