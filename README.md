# kamk-cookiecutters

Various cookiecutters for creating course-related files and directories.

## Prerequisites

* Docker (Desktop)

If you have no idea of what cookiecutter is, spend 1-2 minutes reading this short documentation page: [Cookiecutter docs: Overview](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html).

## Usage

We will use Docker to run the cookiecutter command, utilizing **uvx** (an alias for `uv tool run`). The uv is a Python package installer. The command `uv tool` is an interface for running Python-based tools without installation. We will run uv in a Docker container, so the is no need to even install uv. 

#### üêß Linux / MacOS

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
-v "$(pwd):/workspace" \
-w /workspace \
ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.11-bookworm \
uvx cookiecutter gh:sourander/kamk-cookiecutters -f
```

#### üê¶ Git Bash (in Windows)

```bash
winpty docker run -it --rm \
-v "/$(pwd):/workspace" \
-w '//workspace' \
ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.11-bookworm \
uvx cookiecutter gh:sourander/kamk-cookiecutters -f
```


#### üü¶ PowerShell

```powershell
docker run -it --rm `
-v "${PWD}:/workspace" `
-w /workspace `
ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.11-bookworm `
uvx cookiecutter gh:sourander/kamk-cookiecutters -f
```

### Why the `-f` flag?

The `-f` flag is used to force the cookiecutter to override the existing files. This is required if you want to use the `.` as the target folder, because "this folder" exists.

Running the command above will prompt you to choose a cookiecutter from the list of available cookiecutters. After choosing a cookiecutter, you will be prompted to fill in the required fields. Below is an example of creating a learning diary for a course.

## Using Templates

When launching the `cookiecutter` command, you will be prompted to choose a cookiecutter from the list of available cookiecutters. The available cookiecutters are:

1. Oppimisp√§iv√§kirja (a learning diary)
2. Project (a project documentation)

### Oppimisp√§iv√§kirja (learning diary)

**TIP:** If you are interested in creating similar GIF animations, you can use tool `asciinema` for recording and `agg` for GIF conversion. The tools may not be compatible with Windows.

The steps and brief explanations are in the table below:
